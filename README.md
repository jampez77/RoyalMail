## Installation through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

There is an active [PR](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/2711) to get this into [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), once that is merged then you can install the **Royal Mail** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

Until then you will have to add this repository manually:

Go to HACS -> 3 dot menu -> Custom Repositories:- 

Paste `https://github.com/jampez77/RoyalMail` into Repository field and select `Integration`

Now you should be able to find it in HACS as normal.

You can install the **Royal Mail** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

## Manual Installation
Use this route only if you do not want to use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and love the pain of manually installing regular updates.
* Add the `royalmail` folder in your `custom_components` folder

## Data 
The integration creates a new entity for each parcel on you Royal Mail account with it's current delivery status, all other associated data are saved as attributes. Additionally there are entities for total mail pieces and total number of mail pieces that are due to be delivered today.

The integration will automatically remove a mail piece from your Royal Mail account and Home Assistant 24 hours after the delivery event.
